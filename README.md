# Carnival Tracer

A Ray Tracer based on the "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" book originally written for C++ but I did it in C.

## Note!!!!

The ray tracer works on my machine (hehe). Specifically it is able to compile on clang version 12.0.0 which my machine uses.
Compiling with gcc and the macports port of gcc gives error in the HandmadeMath header file of missing braces, which i frankly haven't tried to resolve.
Also for some reason compiling it with `-O3` crashes it immediately.
I haven't fixed these problem and will try to do them when I am interested to do so (hehe).
